🌾 Crop Data Cleaning (Short Explanation)

1. Input Data:
A list of crop records with rainfall, temperature, and yield.


2. Remove Duplicates:
Keeps only unique records using a simple loop.


3. Handle Missing Values:
Replaces None (missing) values with the average of that column.


4. Normalize Numbers:
Scales numeric values (rainfall, temperature, yield) between 0 and 1 for consistency.


5. Encode Crop Names:
Converts crop names (e.g., “Wheat”, “Rice”) into numeric codes like 0, 1, 2…


6. Print Cleaned Data:
Shows the final dataset — all numeric, complete, and ready for analysis or prediction.
